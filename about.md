Welcome to my website! I am a data scientist in the biotech industry. Previously, I earned my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was co-advised by the [Microsystems and Mechanobiology Lab](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/bex/news/) and the [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php/). My research was in applying deep learning tools to model DNA nanotechnology, and in building microswimmers for uses in biology, medicine and chemistry. Prior to graduate school, I worked as a mechanical engineer in the aerospace and medical device industries. I am passionate about using deep learning to solve problems affecting humans, such as cancer and climate change. I also enjoy learning and exploring a wide range of topics, which is what this blog is for! Thank you for reading.
