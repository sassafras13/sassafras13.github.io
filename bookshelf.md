This page lists the books I have read and, occasionally, some reflections on what they taught me. Reading is one of my favorite ways to learn something new and see the world through other peoples' eyes. 

**Update 7 June 2020:** I wanted to call myself out for having a list that is dominated by white male authors. In fact, the only books on this list that are not written by white men were given to me by a good friend of mine who is much more aware of _who_ writes the books that she reads than I am. I am calling attention to this fact because I am going to change my reading habits to focus especially on BIPOC writers. I will be drawing heavily from books on [this list](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2020-06-04/13-nonfiction-books-to-read-during-george-floyd-protests) and others - I am always open to recommendations. 

## 2021

* **A People's History of the United States** by Howard Zinn (hugely valuable read on all of US history to a novice like me)

* **The Midnight Library** by Matt Haig

* **The Dark Forest** by Cixin Liu (translated by Joel Martinsen)

* **A Place for Us** by Fatima Farheen Mirza (So beautifully written. Each sentence was delicately crafted and the character arcs made me cry.)

* **Patron Saints of Nothing** by Randy Ribay

* **2034: A Novel of the Next World War** by Elliot Ackerman and Adm. James Stavridis

* **The Three-Body Problem** by Cixin Liu (translated by Ken Liu)

* **The Stone Sky** by N.K. Jemisin (Wow. Just wow. I cannot recommend this series enough.)

* **The Obelisk Gate** by N.K. Jemisin 

* **A Promised Land** by Barack Obama

* **The Fifth Season** by N.K. Jemisin (I loved this book so much that I put the sequel on reserve in the library before I even reached the end!)

## 2020

* **Smoketown: The Untold Story of the Other Great Black Renaissance** by Mark Whitaker

* **Americanah** by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie

* **White Fragility** by Robin DiAngelo

* **Dune Messiah** by Frank Herbert

* **Degrees of Difference: Reflections of Women of Color on Graduate School** edited by Kimberly D. McKee and Denise A. Delgado

* **Dune** by Frank Herbert

* **Born a Crime** by Trevor Noah

* **Becoming** by Michelle Obama 

* **So You Want to Talk About Race** by Ijeoma Oluo

## 2019

* **Failure is not an Option** by Gene Krantz

* **Fields of Fire** by Marko Kloos (I love space operas and Marko Kloos has a great series that he's working on right now.)

* **Kidding Ourselves: Breadwinning, Babies and Bargaining Power** by Rhona Mahony (I highly recommend this book to every woman I know, especially young women who are not yet at the stage where they have to balance family and career. It was written in the 90's, though so there are a lot of perspectives that are outdated. For instance, it is mainly written for cis, heterosexual relationships.)
